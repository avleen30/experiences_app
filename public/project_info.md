##User Stories
User should be able to create & find events (aka. experiences)

As a user, I want to browse and join user-created events (aka. experiences) either by date, category or location.  Also, I should be able to create my own events & have other users join it.  

After joining an event, I should be able to post comments on the event's page and be able to rate the event at some point after it has ended.
